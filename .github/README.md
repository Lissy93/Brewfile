## Getting Started



To get started, install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation), then just download the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/Lissy93/Brewfile/blob/master/Brewfile) to `~/.Brewfile`, make any desired changes, and run `brew bundle --global` to install the listed packages. Done üçª

---

Alternatively, there's a guided install process, which can be initiated with:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://lissy93.github.io/Brewfile/install.sh)
```

## About Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an unofficial package manager for MacOS, that makes installing, updating and managing user applications easier.

It only ever installs packages within it's prefix, but then symlinks them to the appropriate place on disk. And since it's just Git and Ruby underneath, it's easy to modify to your liking, and roll back changes if necissary.

Homebrew is used via the terminal, with the `brew` command, but there is an unofficial GUI, [Cakebrew](https://github.com/brunophilipe/Cakebrew). For more infomation, take a look at the [Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Understanding the Brewfile

The Brewfile defines a list of packages, that you'd like to install on your system.

It includes several keywords, like `brew`, `cask`, `tap`, `mas`, etc - this is explained in detail in the [terminology](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#terminology) section of the docs. But in short: Lines which start with brew are packages that are installed via their pre-compiled binaries. Where as casks are applications that require an installer (typically GUI apps). Taps just add additional repositories, and are used when an app's formula isn't published to the main Homebrew repo. And mas is a plugin that enables you to install apps from the Apple App Store from within your Brewfile.

## Bigger Picture

The Brewfile is really useful to incorporate into your dotfiles, or for quickly setting up new machines.
You can see how I am using this in [Lissy93/Dotfiles](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles).
Other package managers have similar features. For example, [here's the scripts](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/installs) I use to manage my package list for Arch, Debian, Alpine and MacOS.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome :)
If you're new to GitHub, see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) for a step-by-step guide on how to submit edits to projects.

Changes to the Brewfile should be made up-stream, directly into [Lissy93/Dotfiles](https://github.com/lissy93/dotfiles) (in [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/installs/Brewfile)), which will then be automatically synced to this repo.
